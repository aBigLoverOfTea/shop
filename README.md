# shop
It's a simply pet-project I made to practice OOP, DB, Git and some Maven. Now it's without any UI, but I planing to add it later or make SHOP 2.0 which'll have an UI (please don't expect this UI will be super juicy, I'm defenitly not designer)

# First day of work
At the beginning I thought it'll be more simply so I didn't make to-do-list (worst mistake of my life) and didn't planing how should I write the app (whorser mistake tbh). Because of this my work today was too chaoticly and I didn't done anything useful. Next day I'll make to-do-list and try to draw an illustration of architecture of the app. Maybe I should learn patterns of projecting, if I have time...?
Changelist:
1. Created files Database.java, Product.java and User.java and wrote basic classes like "Product", "User" and "Database".
2. Added folders 'db' (where I'll contain database) and 'lib' (where contains my h2 library)
